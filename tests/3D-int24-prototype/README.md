software prototype of 3D graphics.

raster-based, renders triangles with texture, without real-time lighting.

### Data representation

may use 16-bit fixed-point for any geometry-related data

### View transform

`perspective * lookAt`

### In-triangle test

done with barycentric coordinates

### Perspective attribute interpolation

a division is required per fragment

### Depth test
